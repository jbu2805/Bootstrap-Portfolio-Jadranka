# Description

This week my task was to build my portfolio using placeholder images and technical skills that we have learned over the last few weeks, with an emphasis on using a combination of bootstrap, HTML and CSS variables, following the set structure of the portfolio as set in the technical criteria. A deployed website should resemble the structure of the previous website, but does not need to be exactly the same. The aim is to use this application in the future to create a portfolio of work that will showcase my skills and talents as they progress over time.
